    \class QtServiceController

    \brief The QtServiceController class allows you to control
    services from separate applications.

    QtServiceController provides a collection of functions that lets
    you install and run a service controlling its execution, as well
    as query its status.

    In order to run a service, the service must be installed in the
    system's service database using the install() function. The system
    will start the service depending on the specified StartupType; it
    can either be started during system startup, or when a process
    starts it manually.

    Once a service is installed, the service can be run and controlled
    manually using the start(), stop(), pause(), resume() or
    sendCommand() functions.  You can at any time query for the
    service's status using the isInstalled() and isRunning()
    functions, or you can query its properties using the
    serviceDescription(), serviceFilePath(), serviceName() and
    startupType() functions. For example:

    \code
    MyService service;       \\ which inherits QtService
    QString serviceFilePath;

    QtServiceController controller(service.serviceName());

    if (controller.install(serviceFilePath))
        controller.start()

    if (controller.isRunning())
        QMessageBox::information(this, tr("Service Status"),
                                 tr("The %1 service is started").arg(controller.serviceName()));

    ...

    controller.stop();
    controller.uninstall();
    }
    \endcode

    An instance of the service controller can only control one single
    service. To control several services within one application, you
    must create en equal number of service controllers.

    The QtServiceController destructor neither stops nor uninstalls
    the associated service. To stop a service the stop() function must
    be called explicitly. To uninstall a service, you can use the
    uninstall() function.

/*!
    \class QtServiceBase

    \brief The QtServiceBase class provides an API for implementing
    Windows services and Unix daemons.

    A Windows service or Unix daemon (a "service"), is a program that
    runs "in the background" independently of whether a user is logged
    in or not. A service is often set up to start when the machine
    boots up, and will typically run continuously as long as the
    machine is on.

    Services are usually non-interactive console applications. User
    interaction, if required, is usually implemented in a separate,
    normal GUI application that communicates with the service through
    an IPC channel. For simple communication,
    QtServiceController::sendCommand() and QtService::processCommand()
    may be used, possibly in combination with a shared settings
    file. For more complex, interactive communication, a custom IPC
    channel should be used, e.g. based on Qt's networking classes. (In
    certain circumstances, a service may provide a GUI itself,
    ref. the "interactive" example documentation).

    Typically, you will create a service by subclassing the QtService
    template class which inherits QtServiceBase and allows you to
    create a service for a particular application type.

    The Windows implementation uses the NT Service Control Manager,
    and the application can be controlled through the system
    administration tools. Services are usually launched using the
    system account, which requires that all DLLs that the service
    executable depends on (i.e. Qt), are located in the same directory
    as the service, or in a system path.

    On Unix a service is implemented as a daemon.

    You can retrieve the service's description, state, and startup
    type using the serviceDescription(), serviceFlags() and
    startupType() functions respectively. The service's state is
    decribed by the ServiceFlag enum. The mentioned properites can
    also be set using the corresponding set functions. In addition you
    can retrieve the service's name using the serviceName() function.

    Several of QtServiceBase's protected functions are called on
    requests from the QtServiceController class:

    \list
        \o start()
        \o pause()
        \o processCommand()
        \o resume()
        \o stop()
    \endlist

    You can control any given service using an instance of the
    QtServiceController class which also allows you to control
    services from separate applications. The mentioned functions are
    all virtual and won't do anything unless they are
    reimplemented. You can reimplement these functions to pause and
    resume the service's execution, as well as process user commands
    and perform additional clean-ups before shutting down.

    QtServiceBase also provides the static instance() function which
    returns a pointer to an application's QtServiceBase instance. In
    addition, a service can report events to the system's event log
    using the logMessage() function. The MessageType enum describes
    the different types of messages a service reports.

    The implementation of a service application's main function
    typically creates an service object derived by subclassing the
    QtService template class. Then the main function will call this
    service's exec() function, and return the result of that call. For
    example:

    \code
        int main(int argc, char **argv)
        {
            MyService service(argc, argv);
            return service.exec();
        }
    \endcode

    When the exec() function is called, it will parse the service
    specific arguments passed in \c argv, perform the required
    actions, and return.

    \target serviceSpecificArguments

    The following arguments are recognized as service specific:

    \table
    \header \i Short \i Long \i Explanation
    \row \i -i \i -install \i Install the service.
    \row \i -u \i -uninstall \i Uninstall the service.
    \row \i -e \i -exec
         \i Execute the service as a standalone application (useful for debug purposes).
            This is a blocking call, the service will be executed like a normal application.
            In this mode you will not be able to communicate with the service from the contoller.
    \row \i -t \i -terminate \i Stop the service.
    \row \i -p \i -pause \i Pause the service.
    \row \i -r \i -resume \i Resume a paused service.
    \row \i -c \e{cmd} \i -command \e{cmd}
	 \i Send the user defined command code \e{cmd} to the service application.
    \row \i -v \i -version \i Display version and status information.
    \endtable

    If \e none of the arguments is recognized as service specific,
    exec() will first call the createApplication() function, then
    executeApplication() and finally the start() function. In the end,
    exec() returns while the service continues in its own process
    waiting for commands from the service controller.

    \class QtService

    \brief The QtService is a convenient template class that allows
    you to create a service for a particular application type.

    A Windows service or Unix daemon (a "service"), is a program that
    runs "in the background" independently of whether a user is logged
    in or not. A service is often set up to start when the machine
    boots up, and will typically run continuously as long as the
    machine is on.

    Services are usually non-interactive console applications. User
    interaction, if required, is usually implemented in a separate,
    normal GUI application that communicates with the service through
    an IPC channel. For simple communication,
    QtServiceController::sendCommand() and QtService::processCommand()
    may be used, possibly in combination with a shared settings file. For
    more complex, interactive communication, a custom IPC channel
    should be used, e.g. based on Qt's networking classes. (In certain
    circumstances, a service may provide a GUI itself, ref. the
    "interactive" example documentation).

    \bold{Note:} On Unix systems, this class relies on facilities
    provided by the QtNetwork module, provided as part of the
    \l{Qt Open Source Edition} and certain \l{Qt Commercial Editions}.

    The QtService class functionality is inherited from QtServiceBase,
    but in addition the QtService class binds an instance of
    QtServiceBase with an application type.

    Typically, you will create a service by subclassing the QtService
    template class. For example:

    \code
    class MyService : public QtService<QApplication>
    {
    public:
        MyService(int argc, char **argv);
        ~MyService();

    protected:
        void start();
        void stop();
        void pause();
        void resume();
        void processCommand(int code);
    };
    \endcode

    The application type can be QCoreApplication for services without
    GUI, QApplication for services with GUI or you can use your own
    custom application type.

    You must reimplement the QtServiceBase::start() function to
    perform the service's work. Usually you create some main object on
    the heap which is the heart of your service.

    In addition, you might want to reimplement the
    QtServiceBase::pause(), QtServiceBase::processCommand(),
    QtServiceBase::resume() and QtServiceBase::stop() to intervene the
    service's process on controller requests. You can control any
    given service using an instance of the QtServiceController class
    which also allows you to control services from separate
    applications. The mentioned functions are all virtual and won't do
    anything unless they are reimplemented.

    Your custom service is typically instantiated in the application's
    main function. Then the main function will call your service's
    exec() function, and return the result of that call. For example:

    \code
        int main(int argc, char **argv)
        {
            MyService service(argc, argv);
            return service.exec();
        }
    \endcode

    When the exec() function is called, it will parse the \l
    {serviceSpecificArguments} {service specific arguments} passed in
    \c argv, perform the required actions, and exit.

    If none of the arguments is recognized as service specific, exec()
    will first call the createApplication() function, then executeApplication() and
    finally the start() function. In the end, exec()
    returns while the service continues in its own process waiting for
    commands from the service controller.

/*!
    \fn QtService::QtService(int argc, char **argv, const QString &name)

    Constructs a QtService object called \a name. The \a argc and \a
