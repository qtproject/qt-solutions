  \class QScriptEngineAgent

  \brief The QScriptEngineAgent class provides an interface to report events pertaining to QScriptEngine execution.

  \ingroup script
  \mainclass

  The QScriptEngineAgent class is the basis of tools that monitor and/or control the execution of a
  QScriptEngine, such as debuggers and profilers.

  To process script loading and unloading events, reimplement the
  scriptLoad() and scriptUnload() functions. scriptLoad() is called
  after the input to QScriptEngine::evaluate() has been parsed, right
  before the given script is executed. The engine assigns each
  script an ID, which is available as one of the arguments to
  scriptLoad(); subsequently, other event handlers can use the ID to
  identify a particular script. One common usage of scriptLoad() is
  to retain the script text, filename and base line number (the
  original input to QScriptEngine::evaluate()), so that other event
  handlers can e.g. map a line number to the corresponding line of
  text.

  scriptUnload() is called when the QScriptEngine has no further use
  for a script; the QScriptEngineAgent may at this point safely
  discard any resources associated with the script (such as the
  script text). Note that after scriptUnload() has been called, the
  QScriptEngine may reuse the relevant script ID for new scripts
  (i.e. as argument to a subsequent call to scriptLoad()).

  Evaluating the following script will result in scriptUnload()
  being called immediately after evaluation has completed:

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_script_qscriptengineagent.cpp 0

  Evaluating the following script will \b{not} result in a call to
  scriptUnload() when evaluation has completed:

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_script_qscriptengineagent.cpp 1

  The script isn't unloaded because it defines a function (\c{cube})
  that remains in the script environment after evaluation has
  completed. If a subsequent script removed the \c{cube} function
  (e.g. by setting it to \c{null}), scriptUnload() would be called
  when the function is garbage collected. In general terms, a script
  isn't unloaded until the engine has determined that none of its
  contents is referenced.

  To process script function calls and returns, reimplement the
  functionEntry() and functionExit() functions. functionEntry() is
  called when a script function is about to be executed;
  functionExit() is called when a script function is about to return,
  either normally or due to an exception.

  To process individual script statements, reimplement
  positionChange(). positionChange() is called each time the engine is
  about to execute a new statement of a script, and thus offers the
  finest level of script monitoring.

  To process exceptions, reimplement exceptionThrow() and
  exceptionCatch(). exceptionThrow() is called when a script exception
  is thrown, before it has been handled. exceptionCatch() is called
  when an exception handler is present, and execution is about to be
  resumed at the handler code.

  evaluated.

  You can reimplement this function to record information about the

  call to positionChange().

  functionExit()) to keep track of the call stack and provide

  the script function will return.
