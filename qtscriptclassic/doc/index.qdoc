	\title QtScript Classic

    	\section1 Description
	
	            This component provides the original (pre-Qt 4.6)
	            implementation of the QtScript module.
		

	
	            Starting with version 4.6, the implementation
	            of the QtScript module in Qt is based on
	            JavaScriptCore, i.e. the JavaScript runtime in
	            WebKit. As an alternative replacement,
	            QtScriptClassic provides the original QtScript
	            implementation, which does not use
	            JavaScriptCore.

                    This component is intended as a
                    migration/mitigation solution for those pre-4.6
                    QtScript users for whom certain issues (mentioned
                    below) restrict their option to employ the new
                    QtScript module. Hence, the maintenance and
                    available support for this component will be on
                    the level of security and build fixes. This
                    component is not recommended for new software
                    projects.

	            The rationale for this component is twofold:

	            Firstly, JavaScriptCore may not compile on all
	            platforms that the original QtScript
	            implementation does. QtScriptClassic is provided
	            so that users affected by such build issues can
	            continue to use QtScript with Qt versions 4.6 and
	            later.

	            Secondly, JavaScriptCore is only available
	            under the LGPL license. QtScriptClassic is
	            provided also under the the commercial Qt
	            license.
