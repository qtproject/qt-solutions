	\title Browser Plugin

    	\section1 Description
	
		    	The QtBrowserPlugin solution is useful for implementing plugins for
			web browser.
		

	
			The project provides a framework that makes it simple to export
			widgets and objects as plugins for web browsers supporting the Netscape
			LiveConnect APIs.

			Supported web browsers are Netscape, Mozilla FireFox and Opera.
			Internet Explorer is supported when the plugin supports ActiveX via ActiveQt.
